This is the homepage of my digital garden - a living collection of notes, thoughts, and ideas that are constantly growing and connecting with each other.

## What You'll Find Here

This space contains my personal knowledge base, including:

- **Articles**: Deep dives into topics I'm learning about
- **Notes**: Quick thoughts and observations
- **Ideas**: Concepts that are still developing
- **Resources**: Useful links and references

## How to Navigate

- Use the **search** to find specific topics
- Browse by **tags** to explore related content
- Follow the **graph** to see how ideas connect
- Check out **recent notes** to see what's new

## Philosophy

This digital garden follows the principle of "learning in public" - sharing knowledge as it develops, even when it's incomplete. Ideas here are living documents that grow and change over time.

Feel free to explore and discover connections between different concepts. Every note is a seed that can grow into something more.
